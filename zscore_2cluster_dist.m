function zc_dist = zscore_2cluster_dist(cluster_a, cluster_b)
% finds the zscored euclidean distance between two clusters, a and b
%
% computes this as the mean distance from each dot in 'a' to the mean of 'b' 
% and visa versa, and then divides that distance by the mean distance from 
% each dot in 'a' to the mean of 'a' (and same for b).
%
% euclid distances are normalized by the sqrt of the number of dimensions
%
% this is analogous to dividing the difference by the standard diviation.
