function m_dist = mahal_2cluster_dist(cluster_a, cluster_b)
% finds the mahalanobis distance between two clusters, a and b
%
% computes this as the mean distance from each dot in 'a' to the mean of 'b' 
% and visa versa
%
% distances are normalized by the sqrt of the number of dimensions
%
% this is analogous to dividing the difference by the standard diviation.
